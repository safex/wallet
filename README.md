## Development

Electron app consists of main (backend) and renderer (frontend) processes. Frontend is based on [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). You'll want to start both in development mode at the same time.

$ npm run dev
```

npm run make-linux-installer
```

separately.

For linux builds, you will need to have `rpmbuild` available on system (`apt-get install rpm`).
